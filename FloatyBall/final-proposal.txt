For my final project some of the ideas I have are to implement a difficulty selector
for this I would have an easy, normal, and hard difficulty.
    Easy would have more good spawns and slower items
    Hard world have more bad spawns and faster items
    Normal would have default settings (even number of good and bad, default move speed)

for my second idea I would like to imlement an in-game pause menu
    this would have options to resume, return to main menu, and restart

for my third idea I would like to have control layout controls
    This would entail being able to choose which side of the screen the
    up-down and left-right options would be. I.e up-down on left or up-down on right

my final idea is to either implement a life system that changes based on difficulty
or change the ball's movement speed based on how big it is (bigger = slower)
